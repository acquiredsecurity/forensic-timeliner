# YAML Configuration Notes for Event Logs Artifact
#
# ignore_filters:
#   - When true, disables both channel and provider filtering.
#   - All event log rows will be included regardless of Event ID or Provider.
#
# filters:
#   event_channel_filters:
#     - Maps log channels (e.g., Security, System) to allowed Event IDs.
#     - Only events matching both channel and listed Event IDs are included.
#     - Set ignore_filters: true to bypass this.
#
#   provider_filters:
#     - Filters events by their Provider name (e.g., "SentinelOne") and Event IDs.
#     - Useful for filtering logs that use custom providers instead of standard channels.
#
#   extensions & paths:
#     - These are ignored by the event log parser but must be defined to match schema.
#     - Leave them as empty lists: extensions: [], paths: []
#
# required_headers:
#   - All listed columns must be present in the CSV for it to be parsed.
#   - If any required header is missing, the file will be skipped.
#
# discovery:
#   - Controls how the parser finds input files.
#   - filename_patterns: looks for files like "_EvtxECmd_Output.csv"
#   - foldername_patterns: looks for folders like "EventLogs"
#   - strict_* flags: allow partial or fuzzy matching when set to false.
