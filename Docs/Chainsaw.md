## Special Behavior

* **Flexible timestamp detection**: All parsers support multiple timestamp fields in order of preference:
  - `timestamp` (primary)
  - `TimeCreated` (fallback)
  - `UtcTime` (secondary fallback)

* **Automatic CSV discovery**: Uses the Discovery utility to find Chainsaw CSV files based on filename patterns, folder names, and file headers.

* **MITRE ATT&CK mapping**: Each parser corresponds to specific attack techniques and tactics for focused analysis.

* **Unified event log format**: All parsers normalize different Chainsaw outputs to a consistent timeline format.

### Expected CSV Format

Chainsaw typically outputs CSV files with these common columns:
- **timestamp/TimeCreated/UtcTime**: Event timestamp
- **Event ID**: Windows event log identifier
- **Computer**: Source computer name
- **detections**: Sigma rule or detection details
- **path**: Source file path for evidence tracking

### Integration Notes

- Place Chainsaw CSV outputs in folders with "Chainsaw" in the name for automatic discovery
- Each parser handles specific attack categories (MITRE ATT&CK techniques)
- The tool automatically maps Chainsaw's detection results to the unified timeline format
- Supports both Sigma rule matches and custom Chainsaw detection rules
